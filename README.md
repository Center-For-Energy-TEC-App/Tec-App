Clone the repo, and run these in the vscode command line
``` 
npm install -g pnpm
pnpm install
pnpm start
``` 

if running into issues - might need to download expo, npm, react, react-native

try `npm add @babel/runtime`
`npm start`

try ```npx expo start```



Run these commands for linting and formating.

- `pnpm exec prettier . --write` - This command will automatically format code according to the prettierrc guidelines

- `pnpm eslint [filename]` - This command currently doesn't work, still working on a fix

[React Native Doc](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) I ended up using to setup the environment
