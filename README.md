Clone the repo, and run these in the vscode command line
``` 
npm install -g pnpm
pnpm install
pnpm start
``` 

if running into issues - might need to download expo, npm, react, react-native

try ```npx expo start```


Run these commands for linting and formating.

- `pnpm lint-check` - check all lint errors or code style issues without modifying any files
- `pnpm lint-fix` - fixes all auto-fixable lint errors and reformats code

[React Native Doc](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) I ended up using to setup the environment
