#### dev meeting at DIB

#### Present Members:

- Yoto

- Andrew

- Tyler

### Agenda

#### New business/agenda
- mention to pedro about yoto / andrew
- mobile app - skip web app for now, just do mobile
- world map issue - any obstacles to PR - can also do switch to ts?
- Google Sheets will likely not be enough to contain all the info we want - Mike wants to potentially add more features such as different energy models or sort countries by income and other variables, and as a result a more scalable option would be useful - look into firebase?
- connecting google sheets to frontend? Work on firebase first and connect firebase instead
    - in the future, may want to connect google sheets to firebase, such that modifying google sheets also modifies firebase
- 2 new issues - part of the design is reasonably finished, so we can start on those parts
    - onboarding: this part opens up at the start of the app, and gives the user important info on how to use the app
    - bottom sheet - need to implement the functionality for a bottom part to be pulled up by the user, which will contain all the interactibility in the app for the user to play around with the climate model
- time availability for the week? + storyboarding - how much time should we allocate for these features
- thoughts on how long the overall project will take + if we need more ppl
- eslint / prettier - see if the 2 commands work - still fixing github actions
- how to start up react native app on phone?

#### decisions
- mobile app - skip web app for now, just do mobile
- yoto --> bottom sheet
- andrew / tyler ---> mysql
- 50 hours ish / week for development
- ask mike if he wants a meeting with the dev team
