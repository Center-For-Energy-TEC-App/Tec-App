#### Present Members:

#### agenda:

- need to discuss how much time different parts of the project will take - should be a long, comprehensive meeting where we cover pretty much everything that needs to be done, and give a rough time estimate

- 2 week sprints / time allocation for the summer: we have roughly 6 two week long sprints

- 1st sprint:
    - Frontend
        - update map to be the 10 different selectable regions
        - bottom sheet is created
        - onboarding feature is created
        - top left temperature / TW bar is created
    - backend
        - backend postgres is setup on Digital Ocean (or potentially another hosting platform) The relations are created (there shouldn't be many if any relations so it shouldn't be too difficult), and columns are filled with data from V10

- 2nd sprint:
    - Frontend / connecting to backend
        - BOLD Clicking on different regions in the map pulls up the respective bottom sheet
        - Global Climate dashboard is created and should be the default dashboard that the user pulls up. 
            - The structure + text should be added. The select bar for 'Distribute Renewables' and 'Data Visualizations' should be created.
    - API / backend
        - Sliders should be created and interact with data. Pulling / moving the wind, solar, etc. sliders should update the renewable sources proportions section/bar. This should be baseline: just affects the current page.



- 3rd sprint:
    - API / backend:
        - after affecting the data for a region, this should update the global bottom sheet with the new values and calculate for new global temperature and TW. This should count for updating multiple regions
        - Reset to Global values button needs to be implemented to reset all changes
